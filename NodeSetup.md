# Setup Node.JS

## Installing Node

On Ubuntu you can install Node.JS from the command line using `apt-get`.

You should already have it installed on your laptop if you completed the codeX intro.

The installation instructions are as follows:

* `sudo apt-get install node-legacy` (this will instal Node as `node` and the `nodejs` command)
* `sudo apt-get install npm`

Open a terminal window:

* type `node` and press enter - you should now be in a Node.JS console - you should get no errors. Use ctrl-C to get out of it
* type `npm` you should see some information about npm on the console

Now you are ready to use JavaScript from the command line.

## Node.JS JavaScript from the command line

Let's create a JavaScript file and run it from the command line:

* Create a file called `hello.js`
* Copy this text into the file: `console.log('hello world!');`
* Save the file
* Now run it using `nodejs hello.js`
* What happens?

So what happened? You liberated your JavaScript knowledge from the command line.

Now prove this to yourself and write some JavaScript that uses:

* an `if` statement
* a `for` loop
* a small function
* what else you need to get comfortable

If you can, create about 5 different JavaScript (.js) files to get more comfortable with JavaScript on the command line.

You can run the scripts using `nodejs filename.js`
